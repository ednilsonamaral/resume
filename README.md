## About Me

Hello, folks! I'm Ednilson Amaral, 25 years old, front-end developer. Father of baby boy Rodrigo; BJJ Fighter; a NFL lover; addicted to japanese food, games (PS4 :p), UFC and codes, a lot of codes!  

I love everything related to web, agile development, readable coding, semantic and reusable. Writing codes without losing my sanity. I love projects with solid and robust architectures, well organized. Today, I work with front-end development, but study a lot for work with MEAN Stack and Ionic in a near future.  

The most attractive for me are projects with biggest challenges, if what I don't know or I've anything difficulty, I going to my friend Google get help, learning with best practices, and always learning new things, new technologies.  

I've very facility to make new friends and love to work and collaborate with teams. And nothing better what work with teams and share our knowledge and experience in favor of always evolve as people and professional.  

I'm always studying new things, new technologies, and I never give up of study! After all, what we learning is the only capital what we never lose, nobody can take this of us!

My first contact with HTML and CSS was when I was 16 years old. But, my professional career started as IT Technical Support, with the same age. At the same time, I developed some web projects how freelancer, but never in agencies. At 2014 I returned to study web development and update my knowledges. Since then, I never stopped.  

Nowadays I work as Junior Front-End Developer at [EWTI](http://www.ewti.com.br/), home office. In addition to developing some projects as a freelancer, in front-end projects or web apps with MEAN Stack. Always looking for personal and professional growth. I also ministered the **Vue.js** course at the [Webschool.io](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL77JVjKTJT2hpxOjdD6VDc1JDXAKs08z5) along with [Igor Luiz](https://github.com/Halfeld).
